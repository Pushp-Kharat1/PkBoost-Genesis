# PkBoost-Genesis
Welcome to PkBoost Genesis, an experimental gradient boosting framework blending Newton gain with Shannon entropy-based mutual information, built with a C++ backend. Ideal for education and research, itâ€™s unoptimized (80x slower than LightGBM). Contributions welcome. MIT-licensed. Contact [your-email-here] for feedback!
